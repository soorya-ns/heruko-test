This blog article shows some examples of markdown code that you can use in your own articles. Check the source code at **blog/2015/markdown-sample.md**.


## Text style

You can set *italic text* or **bold text**.


## Hyperlinks

There are two ways that you can add links to your articles. Using the standard markdown approach, such as this link to [Python](https://www.python.org/) or with html code, such as this link to <a href="https://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide">PySide</a>. You can use what you prefer, the end result is the same.


## Images

As for images, there you can use markdown:

![Alt text](/static/blog/2015/lake.jpg)

or a regular html image tag (with style set):

<img style="width: 70%; margin: 0 15%;" src="/static/blog/2015/lake.jpg" />

You can only style an image and set its size if its an html image element.


## Lists

Here's an example of an ordered list:

1. First element
2. Second element
3. Third element
4. Fourth element

and one of an unordered list:

* First element
* Second element
* Third element
* Fourth element
